Daycare Disaster Readme
Zakary Olyarnik, Dave Petersen
February 2017

INTRODUCTION:
The kids in your daycare are running wild!
If you don't get them under control, they'll start waking the babies and the whole place will descend into chaos!
Give the kids toys to distract them, but know that they won't stay out of trouble for long!
Walk over dropped toys to recollect them to use again!
Stand near babies to sing them back to sleep!

RUNNING THE GAME:
We have provided a Windows build (Daycare Disaster.exe), located in the Builds subfolder and tested for validity.
It must be run with 1920x1080 resolution to display as intended, due to the unpredictable way Unity's UI scales to
different resolutions.  The WebGL build kept freezing on the menu screen, and all attempts to make a Mac build
would not even open.

UPDATES FROM BETA:
-additional animations for sleeping babies, babies starting to wake up, and player singing babies back to sleep
-additional bgm and sfx
-end screen added for an increased "story" aspect.
-babies can now start to wake up randomly
-A second control scheme was added.  The game can now be played using point-and-click in addition to the standard
keyboard W/A/S/D + Space.  Control scheme is switched on a secondary menu that was added.
-A round system was added, so instead of a linear progression with things such as the wakeup rate or child speed,
these numbers now jump up at each new round.  The code can theoretically generate up to 99 rounds, but reaching 10
is quite an achievement.
-numbers tweaking, including the rates at which children affect babies and crying babies affect each other
